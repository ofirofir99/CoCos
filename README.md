## I. Overview
CoCos (Confocal Color Spectral) is a GPU-compatible, Python-based image processing pipeline for data from spectral Confocal Spinning Disk Image Scanning Microscopy (CSD-ISM) systems. It implements the image reconstruction algorithms from "A Spectral Image Scanning Microscope for Multi-Color High-Resolution Imaging" by Bram L., et al. The pipeline decomposes spectral signatures into multi-color images while enhancing optical resolution.

**Problem Solved:** Addresses limitations of conventional multi-color fluorescence microscopy, such as time-intensive sequential acquisition and spatio-temporal chromatic artifacts. CoCos processes data from a system designed for concurrent high-resolution and simultaneous multi-color acquisition.

**Core Contribution:** The system combines a hardware modification (a custom linear Amici prism in the CSD-ISM setup) with the CoCos software. The software performs:
1.  **Spectral Decomposition:** Translates dispersed spectral signatures into distinct color channels.
2.  **ISM Pixel Reassignment:** Computationally enhances spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit.

This approach enables multi-color, super-resolution imaging significantly faster (reportedly 3x) than standard CSD-ISM, with flexible color palette selection.

## III. Installation Guide

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ofirofir99/CoCos.git](https://github.com/ofirofir99/CoCos.git)
    cd CoCos
    ```

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
    * E.g., Using `venv`:
        ```bash
        python -m venv cocos-env
        # On Linux/macOS:
        source cocos-env/bin/activate
        # On Windows:
        # cocos-env\Scripts\activate
        ```
        
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note on CuPy:* Ensure your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA Toolkit are correctly installed. You might need to install a specific CuPy version matching your CUDA Toolkit (e.g., `pip install cupy-cuda11x`). Refer to the [official CuPy installation guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html).
